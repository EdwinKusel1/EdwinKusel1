## ðŸ‘‹Hi there, I'm Edwin Kusel

I am pursuing my passion for coding and problem-solving as a second-year **Computer Science** student at the **University of Pretoria**.

## ðŸ’» What Iâ€™ve been working with
Programming languages Iâ€™ve explored:

ðŸ”¹ Iâ€™m the most confident in C++ and Java.

## ðŸ“˜ Courses Iâ€™ve enjoyed
Program Design (COS 110): Built a strong base in object-oriented programming, inheritance, and polymorphism while learning how to apply these concepts effectively.

Data Structures & Algorithms (COS 212): Gained hands-on experience with classic data structures and algorithm design.

Software Modelling (COS 214): Learned about design patterns and model-driven development, which gave me a new perspective on structuring software.

Concurrent Systems (COS 226): Explored concepts of processes, threads, synchronization, and inter-process communication, which deepened my understanding of parallelism and system performance.
