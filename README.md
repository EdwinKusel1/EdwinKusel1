## 📘 Courses I’ve enjoyed
Program Design (COS 110): Built a strong base in object-oriented programming, inheritance, and polymorphism while learning how to apply these concepts effectively.

Data Structures & Algorithms (COS 212): Gained hands-on experience with classic data structures and algorithm design.

Software Modelling (COS 214): Learned about design patterns and model-driven development, which gave me a new perspective on structuring software.

Concurrent Systems (COS 226): Explored concepts of processes, threads, synchronization, and inter-process communication, which deepened my understanding of parallelism and system performance.
